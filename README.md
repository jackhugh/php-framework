# php-framework

An implementation of a basic MVC php framework, inspired by express and laravel.

## Installation

The included docker-compose means you can get a web server up and running straight away. Ports can be changed in `.env`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Router

The router maps an HTTP verb and URI path to a predefined route.

Create a router and add a route.

```php
// App/routes.php
use Core\Router;

$router = new Router();

$router->addRoute($route);
```

Once all routes have been added the router can be dispatched. It will first execute any globally registered middleware followed by iterating through all routers and routes (in order of creation) until it finds a match. The router will then run all router and route specific middleware followed by the controller method attached to the route. If no matching route can be found then a 404 HTTPException will be thrown.

```php
Router::dispatch($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH));
```

## Route

A route defines how a request will map to a controller. Route has a factory built in for the 5 main HTTP verbs.

```php
use Core\Route;

Route::GET(string $path, \ReflectionMethod $controller, string $type = "HTML");
Route::POST(string $path, \ReflectionMethod $controller, string $type = "HTML");
Route::PUT(string $path, \ReflectionMethod $controller, string $type = "HTML");
Route::PATCH(string $path, \ReflectionMethod $controller, string $type = "HTML");
Route::DELETE(string $path, \ReflectionMethod $controller, string $type = "HTML");
```

An instance of `ReflectionMethod` can easily be generated by using the `Controller	::method('methodName')` factory.

Some examples

```php
// Create a route for 'GET' requests to '/' that will invoke Homepage::show.
$route = Route::GET('/', Homepage::method('show'));

// Create a route for 'POST' requests to '/sumbit' that will invoke Form::submit and return a JSON response.
$route = Route::POST('/submit', Form::method('submit'), "JSON");
```

Route paths can contain parameters by enclosing the parameter name in curly braces. If matched, the value will be passed with the parameter name via the `Request` object to the controller.

```php
$route = Route::GET('/user/{username}', User::method('show'));
```

## Middleware

Middleware can created by implementing `\Core\Middleware`. The necessary `Middleware::run` method is passed a `Request` and `Response` object which can be mutated before being passed onto the next middleware or finally controller. Alternatively this chain can be broken by invoking `Response::send`.

An example middlware that adds a custom header to all responses.
```php
// App/Middleware/CustomHeader.php
use Core\Middleware;

class CustomHeader implements Middleware {
	public function run(Request $req, Response $resp) {
		$resp->headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'some value';
	}
}

// App/routes.php
use \App\Middleware\CustomHeader;

Router::addStaticMiddleware(new CustomHeader());
```

Middleware can be added in a number of ways.

Added directly to `Router` - these are always run, even if a route cannot be found.
```php
Router::addStaticMiddleware($middleware);
```

Added to instances of `Router`.
```php
$router->addMiddleware($middleware);
```

Added to an individual `Route`.
```php
$route->addMiddleware($middleware);
```

## Controller

Controllers contain all the logic behind 

## Request

## Response

## HTTPException
